# trusted mode bypass-loader
got bored and decided to do this.

actual exploit is [here](https://github.com/exploitmafia/trustedmode-bypass), this is just an injector that makes timing super easy.

## how to use
be logged into steam, have csgo closed with the loader exe and bypass dll in the same folder.

as this is now public, i can't for the detection status of this. this may get patched, or the inject could get detected. you may want to use [this](https://github.com/zyhp/vac3_inhibitor) or [this](https://github.com/danielkrupinski/VAC-Bypass-Loader), if you're using it on an important account.

## limitations
this does not allow you to inject dlls from a loadlibrary injector, which you shouldn't be doing anyways. if you really wanted to, you could do that yourself i just see no reason to enable you to do that.
## works with
confirmed works with discord overlay, as well as obs's game capture. ![discord](https://i.imgur.com/R2R3u19.png)

**note about obs:** you must have game capture and obs open and targetting csgo.exe **before** you start csgo!
